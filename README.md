Ouranos

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You'll need these environment variables:

- NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- NEXTAUTH_URL (`http://localhost:3000` while running locally)
